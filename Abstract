Secure cloud storage, which is an emerging cloud service, is designed to protect
the confidentiality of outsourced data but also to provide flexible data access for
cloud users whose data is out of physical control. Ciphertext-Policy AttributeBased Encryption (CP-ABE) is regarded as one of the most promising techniques
that may be leveraged to secure the guarantee of the service. However, the use of
CP-ABE may yield an inevitable security breach which is known as the misuse of
access credential (i.e. decryption rights), due to the intrinsic “all-or-nothing”
decryption feature of CP-ABE. In this paper, we investigate the two main cases of
access credential misuse: one is on the semi-trusted authority side, and the other is
on the side of cloud user. To mitigate the misuse, we propose the first accountable
authority and revocable CP-ABE based cloud storage system with white-box
traceability and auditing, referred to as CryptCloud+. We also present the security
analysis and further demonstrate the utility of our system via experiments.
